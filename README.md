# Kiroku 

Kiroku is an application that takes a boolean expression like `A + B * C ^ D` and creates a circuit, truth table and Karnaugh Map. 

Currently it's in a very alpha stage so it'll be able to only generate the truth table. 

  Currently supports AND, OR, and NOT only.

## Features 

- [x] Truth Table generator (From expression)
- [x] Beautify the Table
- [x] Add support for XOR, XNOR , NOR and NAND operations
- [ ] User input for expression (TUI Based)
- [ ] K-Map generation
- [ ] Circuit Generation
